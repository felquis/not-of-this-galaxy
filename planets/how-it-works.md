# How it works? :stars:

You want to blog about codding but Medium isn't the place for your kind of posts? Well, why don't you use GitHub?

The people you write for are into GitHub!

## Idea

It's simple and I have seem it before somewhere in a far way galaxy I can't remember now.

## Publications

They are markdown files

## Comments

People can comment in your commits or you can link then to an issue created for discussion and
link it at the bottom of the markdown post.

Developers can star your repositories, they can contribute to it directly online on GitHub awesome web editor
and send you pull requests really quick, if you are already blogging you know people say "Something is wrong there, fix it!" now they will send you
Pull Requests fixing it (Only if they are good Aliens :alien:)

## The Best

You can use all GitHub emojis :smirk: :kissing_heart: :green_heart: :shit: :fire: :maple_leaf: to help you express
your feelings :wink:

## GitHub is ready for search engines!
:sunglasses: **deal**

## Typograph is much better than your badass web font blog
 
I mean, its GitHub, reading on it is just good enough!

## When you are finished

You can publish it to master, or create a draft on a branch, or write on your Evernote and just copy and publish, its your choise

(You cant paste images directly in the Web Editor, shame on you GitHub, add this feature kkk)

## You got the idea

Dont think too much, share your knowledge on GitHub! Now!
